# android-ml-kit-vision-with-video
Google's ML-Kit-Vision demo (android) for pre encoded video. Demos for camera preview and still image are also included. This project is actually extension of Google's own sample. Google's sample link: https://github.com/googlesamples/mlkit/tree/master/android/vision-quickstart

# Motivation
Google's sample does not show how to work with pre encoded video, though it shows the processes for camera preview and still image.
